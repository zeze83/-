<div id="abstract-introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Abstract &amp; Introduction</h1>
<p>Diabetes is currently a chronic metabolic disorder in which
prevalence is expediting and occurrence appears in younger age. Even
nowadays, we have different methods of treatment targeting such
diseases. Although diabetes has reaped a host of effective treatments
with advances in technology and medical care, the pain and lengthy
treatment of the disease still places a heavy burden on the patient as
well as the patient’s family. Not only that, since the cause of diabetes
has been proven to have a certain genotype of genetic factors, for many
people in the early stages of the prevention of the disease seems to be
very important. Therefore, in this study, we analyze the effects of
different physiological, lifestyle and social factors on diabetes status
and their interactions by analyzing data from real diabetic patients and
non-diabetic patients. We perform EDA and statistical analysis to
analyze and determine the significance level of the factors, and after
finding the relevant factors, we add them into our logistic model and
run the regression. Finally, based on our statistical test and
regression model, we may provide some insights and recommendations to
the diabetes potential population for preventing diabetes through
lifestyle adjustments, testing of biological indicators, and access to
more social resources.</p>
<div id="data-resource-and-description" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Resource and Description</h3>
<p>Data Source: <a
href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/data"
class="uri">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/data</a></p>
<p>The dataset was collected by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
System (BRFSS) in 2015. This original dataset contains responses from
441,455 individuals and has 330 features. In the dataset we used, there
are 22 variables with 253,680 responses. The diabetes variable is a
three-class diabetes target variable indicating no diabetes,
prediabetes, or diabetes. The potential factors for diabetes are
biological factors such as sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, heart
disease, social factors such as education and income, and habits of
smoking, physical exercise, eating fruit.</p>
</div>
<div id="motivation-and-question-of-interest" class="section level3">
<h3>Motivation and Question of Interest</h3>
<p>Type II Diabetes is a global health concern that affects more than 37
million Americans. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset from the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we aim to uncover the
correlations between diabetes prevalence and social and biological
factors such as sex, education, income, bmi, smoking status and
bioindicators like blood glucose and cholesterol levels. Through
visualizations and statistical analysis in R, we aspire to highlight
patterns that could inform better prevention and management strategies,
thereby contributing to the broader dialogue on public health and
policies related to diabetes.</p>
<p>We are interested in the question of whether some biological factors
and social factors are associated with different outcomes of diabetes.
We investigated the relationship between diabetes and biological factors
such as sex, blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI and social factors such as
income, and physical life habits of smoking, physical exercise, eating
fruits and veggies. Through our investigation, we may learn which
factors play a more significant role in diabetes cases and we aim to
build a model to better fit the factor significance and importance
across diabetes cases. In this way, people can be more vigilant in their
daily lifestyle. Since we are shrinking our mindsight into the variables
that are most commonly observed and involved in daily life, it is a
useful and efficient model to provide reference for potential population
with a family history of diabetes in the society.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
<p>We utilized a partially sorted dataset, in which the NA values were
drawn, and some featured variables were selected. In the data cleaning
process, we created a new dataset to convert all the categorical
variables with numbers to characters. For example, for the variable
<code>HighBP</code> that indicates whether the individual has high blood
pressure or not, we changed “0” and “1” to “no” and “yes” for future
visualization. We also dropped a few variables so that the dataset was
then refined to focus on relevant variables for our study objectives. We
eventually kept variables</p>
</div>
<div id="eda" class="section level3">
<h3>EDA</h3>
<p>Our exploratory data analysis began with plotting a bar chart to
examine the distribution of diabetes types. This revealed a
disproportionately low number of pre-diabetes cases. Consequently, we
decided to exclude this category from subsequent analyses. We redefined
<code>Diabetes_012</code> as a binary variable, indicating 0 for no
diabetes and 1 for diabetes. This simplification allowed for a more
focused analysis on the direct impact of various factors on diabetes
prevalence.</p>
<p>Our dataset contains 441,455 samples and 22 potential factors, they
are: <code>HighBP</code>, <code>HighChol</code>, <code>Cholcheck</code>,
<code>BMI</code>, <code>Smoker</code>, <code>Stroke</code>,
<code>HeartDiseaseorAttack</code>, <code>PhysActivity</code>,
<code>Fruits</code>, <code>Veggies</code>,
<code>HvyAlcoholConsump</code>, <code>AnyHealthcare</code>,
<code>NoDocbcCost</code>, <code>GenHlth</code>, <code>MentHlth</code>,
<code>PhysHlth</code>, <code>DiffWalk</code>, <code>Sex</code>,
<code>Age</code>, <code>Education</code>，<code>Income</code>. To make
our EDA step more efficient, we first compress the variables and focus
on the 13 variables that we are interested in. They are
<code>HighBP</code>, <code>HighChol</code>, <code>BMI</code>,
<code>Smoker</code>, <code>HeartDiseaseorAttack</code>,
<code>PhysActivity</code>, <code>Fruits</code>, <code>Veggies</code>,
<code>HvyAlcoholConsump</code>, <code>Sex</code>, <code>Age</code>,
<code>Education</code>，<code>Income</code>. The reasons for the
selection are for example: 1) some variables do not have sufficient
sample size for study like <code>Stroke</code>; 2) some variables may
have strong correlation with another variable that we are interested in
like <code>Cholcheck</code>(associated with <code>HighChol</code>),
<code>DiffWalk</code> (associated with <code>PhysActivity</code>); 3)
the variables themselves are not measured precisely or accurately enough
for statistical analysis like <code>GenHlth</code>,
<code>MentHlth</code>, <code>PhysHlth</code>,
<code>AnyHealthcare</code>, <code>NoDocbcCost</code>.</p>
<p>As a result, after a close investigation on the variables we include
in our study, we come down to 13 variables. Through these variables, we
decided to do bar charts to first see the distribution of different
variables across two diabetes statuses. In this way, we can visually
understand the distribution of the factors in the datasets. We used
<code>ggplot()</code> + <code>geom_bar</code> to assign the
<code>x</code> variable as Diabetes status, and <code>y</code> variable
as the frequency of the event at the same time using different colors to
label the variable status we are looking at.</p>
<p>From the 13 bar chart distribution plots we made, we discovered the
following trend:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The high blood pressure frequencies are higher than normal blood
pressure frequencies in the diabetes group while it is the opposite in
the no diabetes group. There is a relatively higher proportion of
frequency of individuals with high blood pressure in the diabetes group
than that in the nondiabetic group.</p></li>
<li><p>The high cholesterol frequencies are higher than normal
cholesterol frequencies in the diabetes group while it is the opposite
in the no diabetes group. There is a relatively higher proportion of
frequency of individuals with high cholesterol levels in the diabetes
group than that in the nondiabetic group.</p></li>
<li><p>For both diabetes and no diabetes group, the BMI of the
population is approximately normal with a slight right tail. The BMI
distribution for the diabetes group extends further to the right,
indicating a presence of higher BMI values in this group compared to
those without diabetes.</p></li>
<li><p>For both Diabetes and No Diabetes groups, they have similar
distribution across different age groups. More people in both Diabetes
and No Diabetes are in their age group 9 or group 10, which indicates
they are between 60-70 years old. In younger age groups, there is less
population in our dataset. For the age, the measure and categorize
method is not suitable for our statistical test, since it is a
categorical variable showing the individual’s age. (1 = 18-24 9 = 60-64
13 = 80 or older), and each number does not represent the true age of
the samples, so we cannot do a precise test on it. We decided to drop
this variable.</p></li>
<li><p>For Sex variable, there are approximately the same number of
females and males in the Diabetes group, and there are more females than
males in the No Diabetes group.</p></li>
<li><p>For the Diabetes group, the income distribution was relatively
flat from 1 to 8. For the No Diabetes group, the income distribution is
highly skewed with the highest frequency in the highest income
level.</p></li>
<li><p>In the No Diabetes group, the education is highly skewed with
more frequency in high education levels, while in the Diabetes group,
the frequency of education level remains the same from 4 to 6. This
means that they are in High school graduate, College 1 year to 3 years,
and College 4 years or more education levels.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a higher proportion of fruit eating in the No Diabetes
group than the Diabetes group.</p></li>
<li><p>For both Diabetes and No Diabetes groups, more people tend to eat
veggies.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Smoker variable, more people are smokers than nonsmokers
in the Diabetes group, while a much higher population are smokers in the
No Diabetes group compared to the Diabetes group.</p></li>
<li><p>In the HvyAlcoholConsump variable, there are very few samples of
heavy alcohol consumption in both the Diabetes and No Diabetes groups,
the proportion of heavy alcohol consumption is approximately the same
across two groups, but the sample size of alcohol consumption for the
Diabetes group is very small. So we decided to drop this
variable.</p></li>
<li><p>The heart disease attack frequency is lower than the no heart
disease attack frequency for both diabetes and no diabetes groups while
the proportions are different. There is a relatively higher proportion
of heart disease attacks in the diabetes group. Since we consider heart
disease attacks to be a low probability emergency, we decide to drop
this variable.</p></li>
<li><p>The physical activity frequency are higher for both diabetes and
non diabetes group, while the relative ratio of physical activity in the
diabetes group is much lower than the non diabetes group, which means
there is a higher proportion of the population doing physical activities
in the healthy population than in the diabetes population.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>According to the bar chart distribution, we decide to drop Heavy
Alcohol Consumption. Heart disease attacks these two variables due to
the following reasons.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>For the heavy alcohol consumption, the samples drinking alcohol
in large amounts are overall too few in the sample, so the variable may
not be fully accurately captured. Therefore, if we test on this
variable, it may be not representative and significant.</p></li>
<li><p>For the heart disease attack, it is the same reason that sample
size with heart disease attack is too small, so it may not be
representative and meaningful to test on.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We will also drop age and education these two variables due to
following reasons:</p>
<p>For the age, the measure and categorize method is not suitable for
our statistical test, since it is a categorical variable showing the
individual’s age. (1 = 18-24 9 = 60-64 13 = 80 or older), and each
number does not represent the true age of the samples, so we cannot do a
precise test on it.</p>
<p>For education, it is the same reason that it is a categorical
variable showing the individual’s Education level in the scale of 1-6.
[1 = Never attended school or only kindergarten, 2 = Grades 1 through 8
(Elementary), 3 = Grades 9 through 11 (Some high school), 4 = Grade 12
or GED (High school graduate), 5 = College 1 year to 3 years (Some
college or technical school), 6 = College 4 years or more (College
graduate)].</p>
<p>Therefore, now we come to close with 9 variables that are potential
estimates in our model. They are: 1. High Blood Pressure. 2. High
Cholesterol Level. 3. BMI. 4. Sex. 5. Fruits Consumption. 6. Veggies
Consumption. 7. Smoking. 8. Income Level. 9. Physical Activity.</p>
<p>We decide to make a box plot for the numeric values variables like
BMI. From the box plot for BMI value, we can see that Diabetes group BMI
has a higher median which is around 30 than the median in non diabetes
group of which is around 27. The No diabetes group also has a left
shifted distribution than the diabetes group meaning that generally
Diabetes group has a higher BMI value distribution than the non diabetes
group.</p>
<p>Then since veggies and fruits consumptions are two variables closely
related, we also need to generate a plot for these 2 variable
interrelationships. Our mosaic map shows that through the whole sample,
a large amount of people have a good habit of consuming both fruits and
veggies, and only a small number of people consume veggies without
fruits and quite a few people only consume fruits. There are also a
small number of people who do not consume fruits and veggies.</p>
<p>To further visualize the variable stats, we also build a R table to
investigate each factor’s significance. From the R table 1, we can see
that all the categorical variables have p-values smaller than 0.001
which means that the variables are good to test and may be significant
in our further analysis, so we can include them all in. From the table,
we can clearly see that both proportions of high cholesterol and high
blood pressure are higher in diabetes than in no diabetes. Male
proportions in diabetes are higher than females. Diabetes group BMI has
a mean of 31.9 which is much higher than the mean in non diabetes group
of 27.7. There are higher proportions of smokers in the diabetes group
than in the non diabetic group. The no diabetes group has higher
proportions of high level incomes than the no diabetes group. Diabetes
group also generates a lower proportion of physical activity than the
non diabetes group. Diabetes group also has a lower proportion of people
consuming fruits (58.5% ) and veggies (75.6%) than the non-diabetes
group (fruits:64.3% veggies:82.1%).</p>
<p>Beside that, we also make a small heat map to show the correlation
between each variable to make sure that we are including only the
variables with little correlation to each other to inhibit the
collinearity problem. The heatmap presents a visual representation of
the strength and direction of the relationships between various health,
lifestyle, and socioeconomic variables in relation to diabetes. The
color spectrum from dark blue to bright yellow indicates the range of
correlation coefficients, with darker shades representing weaker
correlations and brighter shades indicating stronger ones. Notably,
variables such as High Blood Pressure (HighBP), High Cholesterol
(HighChol), and Body Mass Index (BMI) show brighter hues along the
diagonal, suggesting a stronger positive correlation with the diabetes
outcome (Diabetes_012). This implies that higher values of these factors
are associated with a greater likelihood of diabetes. In contrast,
variables like vegetable consumption (Veggies) exhibit a dark shade when
correlated with High Cholesterol (HighChol), indicating a weak,
potentially negative relationship.</p>
</div>
<div id="statistical-test" class="section level3">
<h3>Statistical Test</h3>
<p>First, we plotted correlation between predictors. The following bar
chart depicts the correlation coefficients between various lifestyle and
demographic variables with diabetes. High Blood Pressure, High
Cholesterol, and BMI show a positive correlation, indicating that an
increase in these factors is associated with higher diabetes metrics.
Physical Activity and increased Income exhibit a slight negative
correlation, suggesting they may contribute to lower diabetes measures.
Fruits, sex, smoker and vegetable intake also show varying degrees of
correlation, reflecting the complex interplay between socioeconomic
factors, dietary habits, and health outcomes.</p>
<p>ANOVA is used when one variable is numeric and one is categorical,
such as numerical input variables and a classification target variable
in a classification task. The results of this test can be used for
feature selection where those features that are independent of the
target variable can be removed from the dataset. In this case, all
variables have p-values smaller than 0.05, which is significant .</p>
<p>In this dataset, we have many categorical variables, thus we use
Chi-square test for independence. When two features are independent, the
observed count is close to the expected count, thus we will have a
smaller Chi-Square value. Therefore, high Chi-Square value indicates
that the hypothesis of independence is incorrect. In our table, we can
see that all variables have significant small p-values. Therefore, we
can conclude that all variables are independent of each other.</p>
<p>Following the above two tests, we decide to keep all variables for
the model training. Therefore, High Blood Pressure, High Cholesterol,
BMI, Smoker, Sex, Income, Physical Activity, Fruits, and Veggies are all
influential factors for diabetes.</p>

<h3>Model Building</h3>
<p>We plan to fit our dataset by logistic regression models. First, we
split our data set into train and test data set in the portion of 2:1.
Then, we use train data set to fit our model with logistic regression.
From the summary table, we can see that only fruits are insignificant
with a p value of 0.401. After that, we validate the model fitting in
test data set. By calculating the accuracy, 85.89% shows that our
logistic regression model performs pretty well. Therefore, backward
stepwise regression can sometimes exclude important variables or lead to
overfitting. To double check the insignificant variable Smoker by using
backward stepwise, which removes Fruits compared to our logistic
regression model, so we conclude that our model is the most appropriate
model. As a result, Diabetes_binary = -0.050 + 0.123 HighBP +0.087
HighChol +0.008 BMI + 0.009 Smoker + 0.017 Sex - 0.017 Income - 0.036
PhysActivity - 0.008 Veggies, is our final model.</p>

<div id="shiny" class="section level3">
<h3>Shiny</h3>
<p>We developed an innovative Shiny platform designed to enhance user
interaction with our diabetes dataset. Users can select from a
comprehensive array of ‘x’ variables, including but not limited to BMI,
high blood pressure status, and high blood cholesterol status, among
others. Upon selection, the platform dynamically generates and displays
a histogram illustrating the association between the chosen ‘x’
variables and the ‘y’ variable (the status of diabetes). This
visualization not only aids in identifying potential correlations but
also in understanding the extent and nature of the relationship between
various risk factors and the prevalence of diabetes.</p>

<div id="result-data-summaries" class="section level1">
<h1>Result &amp; Data summaries</h1>
<p>We started our analysis by charting the prevalence of different types
of diabetes and noticed a very low count of pre-diabetes. This led us to
focus solely on diabetes and no-diabetes cases, recoding Diabetes_012
into a binary variable. Out of the 22 factors in our dataset of 441,455
entries, we concentrated on 13 key variables that were most relevant and
reliable for our analysis. We used bar charts to visualize and compare
the distribution of these variables between the diabetes and no-diabetes
groups.</p>
<p>Our exploratory data analysis has identified key trends: higher rates
of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and elevated BMI in the
diabetes group; a similar age distribution in both groups, with more
females in the non-diabetes group; more uniform income levels in the
diabetic group, contrasting with higher incomes in non-diabetics;
greater fruit consumption among non-diabetics, while both groups have
high vegetable intake; and more smokers in the non-diabetes group.</p>
<p>Our statistical analysis has shown that lifestyle and demographic
factors such as High Blood Pressure, High Cholesterol, BMI, Physical
Activity, and Income are significantly correlated with diabetes. All
variables tested demonstrate significant relationships with diabetes and
were retained for model training, highlighting the complex interplay of
various influences on diabetes risk.</p>
<p>Chi-square tests have confirmed the significance of all examined
factors, with p-values below 0.05 indicating a meaningful association
with diabetes. Employing nine key predictive variables from our dataset,
our logistic regression model achieved an 85.96% accuracy rate.</p>
</div>
<div id="discussion" class="section level1">
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>Our exploratory data analysis and statistical testing have yielded a
multi-faceted view of the factors influencing diabetes. Data
visualization helps show a discernible association between certain
lifestyle, health-related factors, and socioeconomic influences with
diabetes status. Smokers, alcohol consumers, and people without enough
physical activity are at higher risk of developing diabetes. Individuals
with high blood pressure and high cholesterol appear to have a higher
frequency of diabetes. Conversely, fruit and vegetable consumption shows
an inverse association with diabetes status. Older age, lower education,
and low-income groups show increased diabetes prevalence. Our subsequent
statistical tests evaluate the significance of each independent variable
associated with the diabetes status. Based on ANOVA results, all
variables are significant and should be kept in the model. The
Chi-square tests further delineated the independence of our variables
and reaffirmed that lifestyle, demographic, and socioeconomic factors
are all intricately linked with diabetes in ways that are not due to
chance. Utilizing 9 potential predictor variables in our dataset, our
logistic regression model yielded a high accuracy that effectively
predicted the diabetes status with high reliability.</p>
<p>These findings largely met our expectations. Lifestyle choices such
as smoking and physical inactivity, along with health-related factors
like high blood pressure and cholesterol, have a well-documented
association with diabetes, which our analysis confirmed. The inverse
relationship observed between fruit and vegetable intake and diabetes
prevalence, although expected, adds further evidence to the protective
role of a healthy diet. Socioeconomic factors such as age, education,
and income were also significant predictors, reinforcing the notion that
diabetes is a complex disease influenced by a wide range of interrelated
factors. The high accuracy of our logistic regression model underscores
the predictive power of these variables and validates the comprehensive
nature of our analytical approach.</p>
<p>Our data analysis reinforces the multifactorial nature of diabetes.
Individual life choices, health-related factors, and socioeconomic
influences all interplay in affecting diabetes risk. For individuals
seeking to lower their diabetes risk, our findings support the advice of
maintaining a healthy blood pressure and cholesterol level, avoiding
smoking and heavy alcohol consumption, and engaging in regular physical
activity. Additionally, our data suggests that addressing socioeconomic
disparities could play a crucial role in diabetes prevention efforts. As
such, individuals, healthcare providers, and policymakers should
consider a holistic approach that includes both personal health
behaviors and broader social determinants of health.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This comprehensive study has illuminated the multifaceted nature of
diabetes, a condition that not only affects individuals on a biological
level but is also deeply intertwined with socioeconomic and lifestyle
factors. Our analysis of the extensive dataset from the Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System has yielded crucial insights into the various
influences on diabetes prevalence and progression.</p>
<p>We found that biological factors like high blood pressure, high
cholesterol, and BMI play significant roles in diabetes risk. Lifestyle
choices such as smoking and physical inactivity further exacerbate this
risk. Intriguingly, our data suggests a complex relationship between
diet (specifically fruit and vegetable intake) and diabetes, indicating
the need for further exploration in this area.</p>
<p>From a socioeconomic perspective, our analysis reveals a clear
association between lower income and education levels and increased
diabetes prevalence. This highlights the critical need for targeted
public health interventions and policies that address not only
individual health behaviors but also the broader social determinants of
health. Such strategies could significantly aid in mitigating the risk
of diabetes, especially in more vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the development of our Shiny application provides an
accessible platform for users to interact with the data and draw
personal insights. This tool could be particularly beneficial for
healthcare professionals, policymakers, and individuals at risk,
enabling them to understand and visualize the complex interplay of
various factors associated with diabetes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study emphasizes the importance of a comprehensive
approach to diabetes prevention and management. Addressing the issue
requires not just medical intervention but also social and behavioral
changes. By incorporating a multidimensional strategy that includes
medical care, lifestyle modification, and social support, we can make
significant strides in combating the diabetes epidemic and improving
public health outcomes. Future research should continue to explore these
relationships and develop targeted interventions to reduce the burden of
diabetes on individuals and society as a whole.</p>
